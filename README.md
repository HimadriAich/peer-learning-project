## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement  – Reimagine Peer-To-Peer Learning And Mentorship**

---

## 🎯 Objective

## 💡 Problem Statement & Real-World Use Case

This project solves the challenge of **accessible peer-to-peer learning and mentorship**, especially for students or self-learners who lack structured support.

### Who does it serve?

- Students looking for guidance in specific subjects or skills.
- Mentors who want to give back by sharing their knowledge.
- Lifelong learners in any part of the world.

### Real-World Use Case

In real life, finding a trusted mentor is hard, especially across time zones and languages. This platform:

- Matches learners and mentors based on **skills and interests**
- Supports **video meetings**, **scheduling**, and **asynchronous Q&A**
- Offers an AI-powered chatbot (Groq) for 24/7 support
- Encourages a **global learning community**

It’s like a digital study buddy and mentor-finder — in one place!

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
Cybercrafters

### Team Members:  
- Himadri Aich
- Kaustav Ghosh  
- Arnab Ghosh  
- Aritra Roy

### Approach:  
## 🔍 Why We Chose This Problem

We chose to build a peer-to-peer mentorship platform because **learning is more effective with guidance**, but not everyone has access to good mentors. Especially for students, early professionals, or self-learners, structured help is rare outside of schools or expensive platforms.

## 🧗 Key Challenges We Addressed

- Building a **trustable** environment for mentors and learners
- Handling **multilingual support** and different time zones
- Making the app intuitive for **kids or non-tech users**
- Integrating **AI chat (Groq)** and **live video calls (WebRTC)**
- Designing a full-stack solution deployable without complex setup

## 💡 Pivots, Brainstorms & Breakthroughs

- Originally, we planned a minimal Q&A platform — but during brainstorming, we realized **live mentorship** + **AI support** would make it much more powerful.
- A big breakthrough was figuring out how to **connect Supabase + Groq**, all without needing Google Cloud.
- We pivoted to **simpler UI and animations** after the initial version felt too plain.
- Learned to use tools like **Supabase Realtime, Groq** — and made it work under time limits!

This hackathon journey was an incredible learning experience. From setting up Supabase for the first time, to integrating Groq for an AI chatbot, we explored many tools and built a real-world project from scratch.  
We faced some hurdles, had moments of doubt, but also a lot of fun — and learned more in 2 days than weeks of regular coding! 🚀
